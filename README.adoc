= What?


Given Quarkus being a framework to develop quick start applications running not just
in the Hotspot JVM but also in GraalVM natively, with a relative new lifespan, there
are some shortage of integrations with some other services working for the cloud.

With this extension the aim is registering a Quarkus service in Eureka Registry to expose its responsibility to other
services in a high availability environment in which the service is reached by loadbalancers to any of their instances.

From the client side point of view, the plugin connects to the Eureka Server to retrieve the bridge which brings the link
to the actual application to consume their services. That connections are made through their application id or application name rather a static ip.

The implementation of this extension is built based in the documentation at:

link:https://quarkus.io/guides/extension-authors-guide[Quarkus - writing your own extension, window=_blank].

The dependencies that this extension uses are just quarkus extensions and some other dependencies for testing.

The most recent quarkus version at the time, from which this extension has been built, is `2.7.1.Final`.

The java version used to implement such plugin is java 11.

= How?

To use the plugin, other quarkus extensions need to be provided `*quarkus-rest-client*` and `*quarkus-resteasy-jackson*`
which are used to communicate with the other end where is the registry.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-rest-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Including the extension in your application, the next dependency needs to be added to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.fmcejudo</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-eureka</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.14</version>
</dependency>
----

An alternative way to do this is through `maven` quarkus tool as:

`mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextension="com.github.fmcejudo:quarkus-eureka:0.0.14"`


[NOTE]
====
This dependency is in `maven central`

== REGISTRATION

=== PARAMETERS WHICH PLUGIN DEALS WITH

Configuring connection with the registry, exposing the name of your service, requires adding the next properties to
your quarkus `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.eureka.enable=<boolean to tell the application wether to register or not in Eureka. Default to true>
quarkus.eureka.port= <your application port, it should match with quarkus.http.port. If it does not exist,it takes quarkus.http.port>
quarkus.eureka.hostname= <your application address. By default the host where the application has started up>
quarkus.eureka.context-path= <your application context path, using the default one ${quarkus.http.root-path:/}>
quarkus.eureka.prefer-ip-address= <whether or not to override hostname with the application LAN IP address. By default this is set to false>
quarkus.eureka.name= <name of your application in Eureka. It takes quarkus.application.name if it does not exist>
quarkus.eureka.vip-address= <how your application is recognised by clients>
quarkus.eureka.home-page-url= <home path of your application>
quarkus.eureka.status-page-url= <where we can check your status>
quarkus.eureka.health-check-url= <saying if you application is alive and kicking. { "status": "up" }>
quarkus.eureka.region=default
quarkus.eureka.prefer-same-zone=true
quarkus.eureka.service-url.default=<urls of your Eureka instances. ie: http://localhost:8761/eureka>
quarkus.eureka.metadata.<tag-key>=<tag value> #These keys values will be shown in Eureka registry if available i.e.: jhipster-registry
quarkus.eureka.ignore-network-interfaces=<comma separated list of network interface names to ignore, default: none>
quarkus.eureka.health-check-initial-delay= <delay in seconds before initially checking health before registration. Default 3>
----

i.e: Given a `sample` application, your configuration properties to work with quarkus-eureka looks like:

[source,properties]
----
# Configuration file
# key = value

quarkus.http.port=8001
quarkus.application.name=sample
quarkus.eureka.region=default
## configuration related to reaching the eureka servers
quarkus.eureka.prefer-same-zone=true
quarkus.eureka.should-use-dns=false
quarkus.eureka.service-url.default=http://localhost:8761/eureka
quarkus.eureka.metadata.app-key=my-quarkus-app
quarkus.eureka.ignore-network-interfaces=lo0
----

Having as default values for remaining properties the following:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.eureka.host-name=<host address>
quarkus.eureka.prefer-ip-address=false
quarkus.eureka.port=${quarkus.http.port}
quarkus.eureka.name=${quarkus.application.name}
quarkus.eureka.context-path=${quarkus.http.root-path:/}
quarkus.eureka.home-page-url=/
quarkus.eureka.status-page-url=/info/status
quarkus.eureka.health-check-url=/info/health
----

=== HEALTH INSTANCES

In case you don't want to implement the heartbeat of your application, you might make use of:

link:https://quarkus.io/guides/health-guide[Quarkus - Microprofile Health]

Other alternative is creating your own controller to attend them, a simple approach for this might be:
[source,java]
----
@Path("/info")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class HealthCheckController {

    @GET
    @Path("/health")
    public Response health() {
        return Response.ok(Map.of("STATUS", "UP")).build();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/status")
    public Response status() {
        return Response.ok(Map.of()).build();
    }

}
----

applying the endpoints where match.

Eureka registry seems to be ready to work in cloud platforms such as AWS and the API so recognise it. But in this
first approach it just connects with Eureka instances in by whole urls.

=== WRAPPING UP WITH CONFIG
With this configuration, once you start up you application, it should register itself in the list of locations
provided, checking the healthy of its own in the network and the state of the Eureka service where it is registered.
It keeps checking at the moment every 40 seconds the availability of them, updating the state if feasible.

Bare in mind that Eureka Server is a service which instances need to teach, Eureka Server itself does not ask to instances
about their states.

== EUREKA CLIENT

=== USING `EASILY` THE CLIENT

As client to consume the services posted in Eureka Server, there is a `EurekaClient` class which requests
for services in Eureka Server, bringing one of the `UP` status available and presenting the `WebTarget` configured with
the actual url to the service to link with.

A mechanism has been implemented to select one instance amongst the available ones for the given service, this can be done
as:

[source,java]
----

    @Inject
    @LoadBalanced(type = LoadBalancerType.ROUND_ROBIN)
    public EurekaClient eurekaClient;

----

Being the available ones `ROUND_ROBIN` or `RANDOM`.

This `WebTarget` instance comes from `RestEasy` implementation which is Quarkus compatible.

To request for an endpoint in `sample` application, results in:

[source,java]
----
 return eurekaClient.app("sample")
                .path("/actuator/health")
                .request(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)
                .get()
                .readEntity(String.class);
----

== CONNECTING TO SECURED EUREKA-SERVERS

In the use case in which your Eureka Server is secure with basic authentication, the way to proceed in your
`application.properties` file is adding the credential as:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.eureka.service-url.default=http://user:pass@eureka-server/eureka
----

The credentials are added to the request headers in the `Authorization` field with the value encoded as `Basic <base64 value>`

= Why?

The reason to create the extension have been to have other way to make Quarkus openness to use within other services
and the way to keep fit learning other new technologies which spread around the business.

This is nothing, but a way to connect Quarkus to the world easily with the guides provided and hopefully one of the
multiple integrations with the services we use as developers to monitoring, tracing and scaling our application,
letting be more reliable for the future of our work.
